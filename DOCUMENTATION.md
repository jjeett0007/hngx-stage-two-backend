Limitations and Assumptions

    The API operates with the expectation that the "name" field exclusively consists of alphabetic characters, excluding numbers or special characters. Additionally, in case of errors, the responses may provide a generic message stating "Something went wrong".

Setting Up and Deployment

To set up and deploy the API locally or on a server, follow these steps:

    Clone the API repository from [GitHub Repo URL].
    Install the necessary Node.js dependencies using npm install.
    Configure the database connection by providing the MongoDB URI and database name.
    Start the API using npm start.
    Access the API endpoints as described in the documentation.

To deploy the API on a server, you have the option to utilize platforms such as Heroku, AWS, or any alternative cloud service. It's crucial to establish environment variables for safeguarding sensitive data, such as database credentials.

That's it! You now have a basic documentation file that outlines the standard formats for requests and responses, sample usage, limitations, and deployment instructions for your REST API.
